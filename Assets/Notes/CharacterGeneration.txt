About Procedural Stuff

I'm thinking about how to make Human Characters Procedural

First, Height...
Now this all depends on the character
If big head, most of the height will be head.

Here are some properties I'm thinking so far
enum sex (Male, Female)
float headSize
enum headType (Square, Round, Egg)
enum hairType (Abe, Robert, Male1, Male2, ..., Female1, ...)
color hairColor
enum faceHair (Beard, Moustache, Goatee)
color faceHairColor
float bodylength
enum bodytype (Standard, Fit, Muscle, Fat, Skinny)
enum eyetype (Standard, OneColor, NoPupil)
color eyecolor
enum hat (Tophat, ConfederateCap, ...)
enum costume (None, Confederate, Union)
enum shirt (None, Tshirt, Polo, ButtonUpLongSleeve, ButtonUpShortSleeve)
color shirtColor
enum pants (None, Jeans, Skirt, LongSkirt, MiniSkirt, LongCreased)
color pantsColor
enum shoes (tennis, dress, flipFlops)
color shoeColor
plus more!
