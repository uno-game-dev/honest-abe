Sometimes, I’ll come across a pre-existing soundscape that I think may fit within one of the game’s levels, but not be sure exactly how it might be used. In that case, I’ll still upload the sound, but not bother to chop it up into pieces that would be easier to use. It’s just not worth the trouble. So if you find a sound you like, but you only need part of it, let me know, and I’ll cut it up and automate it to your specifications.
