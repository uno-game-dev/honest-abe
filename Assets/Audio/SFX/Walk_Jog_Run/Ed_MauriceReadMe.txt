Hello developer, a quick note on footsteps:

1.)
The file “GrassLoop_1.1” can be looped perfectly. I set it up such that if a loop is the best way to go, this file can just be looped seamlessly without sounding off rhythm. I apologize for not doing this before.

2.)
You may listen to the 7 individual footsteps and think “well these all sound the same” and thus use only one or two over and over. Don’t do this. Yes, individually, to you, they all sound the same. But they’re not. When your ear hears the individual sounds back to back looping (as would happen if you use them for Abe walking) THEN you’ll pick up the sameness. So, if we wind up going with the use-a-bunch-of-single-steps-for-walking option, USE ALL 7. And make the order they play random.


k thanks
